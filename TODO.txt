* single-stroke dictionary:
    - remove all words that end in common suffixes (ation, ed, ant, ...) or prefixes (post, de, in, ...)
        - (maybe let all of the most common words pass)
        - make sure to not delete affixes that are entire words
    - of the remaining take some 10 or 20 thousand words (maybe more, check which ones are at the border) and provide them in a counter dictionary
    - revise which syllable is the center one. Current system too dumb
    - revise diphthongs (consider making j a vowel, think about how to handle ow)
        - If I make j a vowel or otherwise remove it from the consonants, I have a free space for the dj and tsh sounds, which could be really rather utility)
        - do think especially hard about flowerpot
    - build dictionary from english to simplified ipa
    - build dictionary from simplified ipa to steno notation
    - from those, build a dictionary from english to steno notation, ordered by frequency
    - reverse the dictionary to go from steno to a list of english words(, maybe annotate each word with its frequency)
    - split each entry, so each steno is only associated with one english word, making use of the numbers 1-3 for conflicting entries. Also keep a list of rejected words
    - disallow single-letter notation
    - revise how words with affixes are stripped to produce more valid words
        - then only strip and reject words if the result is valid, which allows for more short affixes to be used.
        * expand the tsh and dsh sounds while doing that
    - think about trying to detect compound words like "downgrade"
        - would remove a lot of words from single-stroke, but also make things clearer
        - list all rejected words by their composition, in ipa and english
        - create strokes for the affixes probably (not sure if necessary, but probably useful)
    * build dictionary from steno notation to Plover notation
        * find better keyboard layout
        * get more rows into plover
    * finally, build the dictionary from Plover to English
* multi-stroke dictionary

* bugs and improvements
    - fix bugs, so stems can only be minimal stems
    - use suffix trees for the affixes as well
    - make it stop thinking that 'b' is a valid word
    * fix multiplicity. i.e. use data from counted_english for affixes/compounds
    - make decomposition of words better. affixed and affix_free words are too separate
    * choose the notation based on actual conflicts rather than just the length-heuristic
    * the dictionary wants to pronounce "corp" like corporation, which is a little awkward
